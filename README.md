# Sketching - Complex - Thing

A collection of (useful) tools and ideas to approach, sketch, explore, simulate, fabricate and eventual (control) complex and maybe not so complex installations with processing. 

## Why?
- Classical sketching methods are limited to an overviewable degree of complexity.
- Code is your way of thinking!
- You can’t draw!
- You wan’t to apply generative principles. 
- Parametric (change behavior, scale dimensions)

## Stages
1. Sketch / Think / Reflect
2. Simulate (eventually in 3D)
3. Control (optional)
4. Fabrication (optional)

## Processing / Libraries
* Tools
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Processing VSCode Extension for VSC
  - Processing Language Extension for VSC
* Libraries
  - controlP5 (gui elements)
  - peasyCam (3D control)
  - box2D
  - ToxicLib

## Sketch / Think / Reflect
- sketching with code
- use generative principled
- for project proposals (etc)
- can rough or polished

## Simulate (eventually in 3D)
- more detailed sketch
- simulating exact behaviors of the system
- understand the actual project
- tune it to a specific point
- check feasibility

## Control (optional)
- software that runs / controls the final installation

## Fabricate (optional)
- export generative components to for digital fabrication (e.g. laser cutting, 3D printing or CNC miling)
