# Sketching - Complex - Thing

A collection of (useful) tools and ideas to approach, sketch, explore, simulate and eventual (control) complex and maybe not so complex installations with processing.


## Why?
- Classical sketching methods are limited to an overviewable degree of complexity.
- Code is your way of thinking!
- You can’t draw!
- You wan’t to apply generative principles. 
- Parametric (change behavior, scale dimensions)

## Stages
1. Sketch / Think / Reflect
2. Simulate (eventually in 3D)
3. Control (optional)

## Processing / Libraries
* Tools
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Processing VSCode Extension for VSC
  - Processing Language Extension for VSC
* Libraries
  - controlP5 (gui elements)
  - peasyCam (3D control)
  - box2D
  - ToxicLib
